## Generalized Linear Models
Generalized glm instead of lm. Specify link function which "transforms" data to function normally

Doesn't require normally distributed errors and residuals. 
Don't need homogeneity of variance across catagories.

```{r}
library(curl)
f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN588_Fall21/graddata.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",")
head(d)

# glm of admit~gre
glm <- glm(data = d, admit ~ gre, family = "binomial")
summary(glm)

```
